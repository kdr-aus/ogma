# Command Line Interface (CLI)

When the ogma binary is run with no arguments, a vanilla REPL is started.
This is the most common use of ogma, however the CLI has optional paramters which can be used to
alter this behaviour. To view these parameters use `ogma --help` in your terminal.

## Definition Files
---
The ogma binary accepts paths to _definition_ files, in the form of `--def=path1 --def=path2` etc.
It can also accept glob patterns: `--def=path/to/*.ogma`. These definition files extend the REPL's
context and are useful for importing common definitions.

## Processing Files
---
Any trailing arguments are taken as _paths to batch files_. When these paths are present, the REPL
is **not** started, instead each batch file is processed in sequentially. This is useful for
incorporating ogma processing into a bash script workflow.
