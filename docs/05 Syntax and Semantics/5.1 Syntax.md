# Syntax
---

`ogma` uses predominantly a **prefix** notation syntax with a focus on **pipelining** output
into the next input. It has a type system which falls between dynamic and static, and
supports user defined commands (**definitions**) and types.

## Syntax
For a given **block** of code, the syntax is `cmd arg1 arg2`, that is
a command, followed by zero or more **arguments** separated by _spaces_.
The _input_ into the block comes from the _output_ of the previous block. Blocks can be
chained together into an **expression** by using the pipe character (`|`).
A simple example shows the different parts:
```plaintext
\ 'Hello' | + ', ' | + 'world!'
^           ^        ^          --> Commands
  ^-----^     ^--^     ^------^ --> Args
^-------^   ^----^   ^--------^ --> Blocks
^-----------------------------^ --> Expression 
```

The syntax might be initially unfamiliar, especially when working with arithmetic
expressions, because of the prefix notation. The notation allows for less ambiguity. Take
for example the mathematical expression: `3 * 4 - 4 / 2`. The order of operations defines
how this should be evaluated, but this does create parsing and evaluation ambiguity unless
explicitly defined. The order of operations is an _implicit_ assumption based on
collective math education. In `ogma` the expression would be defined: `\ 3 | * 4 | - {\4 |
/ 2}`. Notice the `{\4 | / 2}` part, this is a **sub-expression**.

### Argument types and Sub-expressions
Arguments can be specified as literals (strings, numbers, booleans, nil), variables, or
_expressions_. Strings are encased in matching quote or double quote characters, these quotes can
be skipped if the string is just a single word. Booleans and Nils use the pound character to flag their
value. Variables lead with the dollar sign. Expressions are defined by wrapping the expression in
curly braces.

| Argument | Examples         |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| Number   | `0`, `-3`, `3.14`, `1e6` |
| String   | `foo`, `'foo bar'`, `"Hello, world!"` |
| Boolean  | `#t`, `#f` |
| Nil      | `#n` |
| Input    | `#i` |
| Variable | `$x`, `$foo`, `$foo-bar` |

Sub-expressions are just regular expressions encased in curly braces. They can be nested
arbitrarily deep, and generally take on the _input_ of the _block they are defined in_. For
example, this expression uses sub-expressions to branch on conditionals:

```plaintext
\ 10 | if {mod 3 | = 0} 'divisible by 3'
	  {mod 5 | = 0} 'divisible by 5'
	  {mod 7 | = 0} 'divisible by 7'
	  'something else'
```

Each sub-expression calculates the modulus of the _input_ (which is 10) to a number (3,5,7) and
checks if it equals zero.

### Sub-expressions without the braces
There exists a shorthand for sub-expressions which can be used as the _last_ argument. The
shorthand allows one to not use braces to define the extents of the expression, instead relying on
the right-associativity of arguments. This means that a block which takes the form `cmd1 arg1 {cmd2
arg2}` where the 2nd argument into `cmd1` is an expression, can be written as `cmd1 arg1 cmd2 arg2`.
This nests, such that `cmd1 arg1 {cmd2 arg2 {cmd3 arg3}} = cmd1 arg1 cmd2 arg2 cmd3 arg3`. This has
some important details:
1. Only the trailing argument can use this syntax,
2. A pipe character still defines the boundary to the shallowest block.

For instance, `cmd1 arg1 { cmd2 arg2 | cmd3 } â‰  cmd1 arg1 cmd2 arg2 | cmd3`.

### User defined definitions
Users can define their own implementations using the example syntax [(in further
detail)](#user-defined-implementations):
```plaintext
def foo (x y) { + $x $y }
```

Users can define their own types using the example syntax [(in further
detail)](#user-defined-types):
```plaintext
def-ty Foo :: Bar | Zog {x:Num y:Num}
```
