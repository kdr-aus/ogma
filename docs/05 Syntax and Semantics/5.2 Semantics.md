# Semantics
---

The evaluation semantics of `ogma` is built upon the idea of _pipelines_ of data. The _output_ of a
block becomes the _input_ of the subsequent block. Multiple blocks taken together make up an
_expression_. When `ogma` goes to to process an expression there are three distinct phases:
1. Parsing - the expression is parsed for validity,
2. Intermediate checking - checks the types, semantics of commands, and produces a streamlined
   evaluation model
3. Evaluation - evaluates the output of the previous phase.

Errors will usually occur in the 2nd phase when types and semantics of commands are
checked. This is where a solid mental model of the evaluation is handy. For example, say an
expression is defined as `\ 3 | if {= 3} #t 'foo'`, this is valid syntax but the semantics of the
`if` command require that both branches return the same type.

The semantics of nested sub-expressions is worth understanding as well. An example is again using
an `if` command: `if {= 'Hello'} {+ ', world!'} 'Hello, world!'`. In this example, if the input is
`Hello`, the **input** is concatenated with `, world!` (using the sub-expression `{+ ', world!'}`).
Note how the input is **_the same input_** which was tested for equality.

> A good technique to check that the input into the block is what is expected, test a _portion_ of
> the expression in the REPL and see what the output is.
