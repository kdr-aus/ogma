# Debugging

To go about debugging an ogma expression, it is helpful to break it apart into the smallest
_blocks_ possible.
The types that are going into and out of a block are generally inferred, but an _impl_ definition
can help force the types, shedding light on where a type assumption may have been incorrect.
A useful tool for debugging operations across tables is to save a temporary table to disk and
inspect its contents. This can be done by inserting `save tmp.csv` as a trailing block.
Another handy debugging tool is the REPL. Any implementations can be tested when loaded into the
REPL. If working with a batch file, link the batch file into the REPL and use `def --load` to load
the definitions. This way the definitions can be tested using the REPL.

## Investigate Types

There are times when understanding the types of an expression might be required.
The `typify` command takes an argument which will be expanded with type annotations.
This can illuminate the way ogma is typing your expression.

```plaintext
>> typify { ls | fold 0 + $row.size }
{:Nil ls |:Table fold 0:Num {:Num + {:Num . $row:TableRow size:Str }:Num }:Num }:Num
```
