# Introduction
---

`ogma` is the expression language used by `daedalus` within `kserd` blocks and the REPL.
The language is syntactically lightweight yet boasts powerful constructs designed to
efficiently work with _tabulated_ data. Using `ogma` with `kserd` enables one to transform
data for visualisation, whilst use in the REPL allows for data _manipulations_ and
_investigation_.
Becoming familiar with the `ogma` language is beneficial for efficient `daedalus` use.
This file documents some of `ogma` and provides some examples to help learn the language.
It is recommended to play around in the REPL whilst reading this document.
