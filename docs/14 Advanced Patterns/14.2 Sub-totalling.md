# Sub-totalling
---

Another common pattern is to subtotal columns in a table. For this example, `ls` is run on the
_data_ folder. Subtotalling is as simple as _folding_ over a column, summing along the way. It
looks good to _add_ this as an additional row to the table:
```plaintext
ls data | let $t | fold 0 + $row.size | let $total | \$t | append-row 'Total' #n $total
```

The `#n` pads the second column with `Nil` as `size` is the third column along.
