# Cumulative Aggregation
---

To create a column which is the cumulative sum of another column, a table column can be created
which is then appended onto the original table.
```plaintext
open 'table.csv' | let $t | fold {range 0 1} {
    append-row { last get i | + $row.'Column' }
} | skip 1 | ren i 'Cumulative' | let $c | \$t | + --cols $c
```

The expression above does the following:
1. It opens a table and binds it to the variable `$t`,
2. It _folds_ over that table using a seed table with a single row of value zero (this is the
   `{range 0 1}` syntax. **The curly braces are crucial**
3. For each fold, it _appends_ a number. The appending gets the last row and extracts the value in
   the `i` column. This was the previous value, and for the first row the previous value would be
   zero,
4. It adds that value to what is in `Column` for the row,
5. After folding it skips the first row (since this was the seed row),
6. Renames the default 'i' column to 'Cumulative',
7. It then sets this column as `$c`, resets the input to the original table `$t`, and adds `$c` to
   the table by columns.
